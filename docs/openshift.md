# Tackling Openshift

## If you're running out of disk space, try to check these

### Disk Usage

SSH into your gear and run Linux `du` command [du manual](http://www.tecmint.com/check-linux-disk-usage-of-files-and-directories/)

`du -hc`

For sorted output:

`du | sort -n`

### Show gears quota:

rhc show-app live --gears quota

### Clean some space:

`rhc app-tidy`

Deletes all the contents of the log and /tmp directory on the gears to free up disk space. Useful to give you some disk space when your app has run out of space
