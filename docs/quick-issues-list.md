# Issues to fix

BP01

Incorrect leader is displayed in the header.

STR:

1. Login as RySy@gm. Open other leader. Observe the toolbar.

Actual: Other leader is shown in the toolbar, not the logged in one.
Expected: Logged in leader should be shown.

At the same time, correct info is show in the Leaders page, — "[я]" highlights the logged leader correctly.
